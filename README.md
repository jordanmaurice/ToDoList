This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project when built creates a simple ToDo List page using React.  All logic for the todo list is housed within App.js, and all styles are within src/App.css.

For a live demo please visit [my website](https://jordanmaurice.dev/todo-react).
